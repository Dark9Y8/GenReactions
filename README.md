= Additional Notes: =

Credit #1: This plugin is a modified version of "What's Your Reaction" Plugin by <a href="http://www.bringthepixel.com/">Bringthepixel</a> which they are using on "Bimber Viral Theme".

Credit #2: The animated emojis are created by <a href="http://www.be.net/Hassan_gde/">Hassan Alkhatir</a>

Credit #3: Recoded by <a href="https://fb.me/dark9y8">Rahul Kumar</a>

I'm not a PHP coder or developer. I have little basic knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS so I edited this plugin to make it look awesome and cool.
